              I grew up in McCausland, a small town in rural Iowa, and went to North Scott High School in Eldridge.
              While in high school, I was a varsity track and cross country runner, head of the drumline, lead drummer
              in for the jazz band, and a member of the theater program.

              A week before my senior year of high school began, I made a life changing decision: I removed Spanish 4 from my schedule, and added Computer Sciense. 
              I completed the high school course, began learning more on my own, and decided to major in Software Engineering at Iowa State University (Go Cyclones!). 
              In addition to my university courses, I have take online courses over topics like full stack development, 
              React JS, SQL, docker, and Jenkins. Going forward, I wish to keep learning everything I can about 
              software developemnt, and grow both as a person and engineer along the way.
